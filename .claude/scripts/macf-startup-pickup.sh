# macf-startup-pickup.sh — canonical SessionStart hook (groundnuty/macf#768)
# that surfaces pending work at session start and, for auto-resuming roles,
# submits a follow-up prompt so the agent picks the queue up without an
# operator nudge. Canonicalizes the "check pending issues at startup, then
# self-nudge" behavior agents had previously hand-rolled per-workspace in
# their gitignored `settings.local.json` (with duplicated `gh issue list`
# logic and, in at least one case, a buggy single-`Enter` tmux submit that
# never actually reaches Claude Code's multi-line input mode).
#
# THIN BY DESIGN: this hook does NOT hand-roll a GitHub query. It delegates
# the entire queue-discovery + inbox-drain + coordination.md §Communication 5
# sweep-injection to the plugin's OWN `issues` command — the exact command
# backing the `/macf-issues` skill (see plugin/skills/macf-issues/SKILL.md)
# — which already mints its own fresh GitHub token via the refresh-aware
# client (macf#338) and already does install-set x label pending-work
# discovery. Only the SUBMIT step below is bash: the Claude Code TUI's
# multi-line-input Enter quirk has no non-bash equivalent, and it goes
# through the sanctioned tmux-send-to-claude.sh 2-step-Enter helper — never
# an inline `tmux send-keys ... Enter`, which silently fails to submit.
#
# ROLE-AWARE DEFAULT (DR-026): auto-pickup defaults ON for every actuator
# role (code-agent / science-agent / devops-agent / writing-agent / the
# exp-* variants) and OFF for the auditor — the auditor is a propose-only
# sensor/discussant, never an actuator, and auto-submitting a work-pickup
# turn would make it act. This mirrors
# `startupPickupAutoResumesByDefault()` in
# packages/macf/src/cli/role-settings-model.ts (a lockstep test pins both
# copies to the same 'auditor' sentinel — the TS side can't be imported by
# bash, so the policy is intentionally duplicated, not derived).
#
# This gate is enforced by THIS SCRIPT reading `MACF_AGENT_ROLE` at runtime
# (exported by claude.sh / env-files.ts), NOT by conditionally omitting the
# settings.json entry at `macf init`/`update` generation time: `macf rules
# refresh` (the hand-wired-substrate distribution path this hook ALSO ships
# through, alongside `macf init` / `macf update`) has no workspace-role
# information available at write time (no `.macf/macf-agent.json` to read —
# see rules-refresh.ts). So the settings.json entry is written
# unconditionally for every workspace/role, mirroring
# check-auditor-never-acts.sh's own "distribute everywhere, gate at runtime"
# shape.
#
# Hook contract (SessionStart): JSON on stdin (ignored — the workspace path
# comes from $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR); STDOUT is injected into the agent's
# context. OBSERVATIONAL for the query half (deposits the plugin's own
# `issues`-command output into the agent's context, identical to what
# `/macf-issues` would print) and NON-BLOCKING throughout — the script
# ALWAYS exits 0 (fail open on a missing plugin mount, a query error, a
# missing tmux session, or any internal fault) so it can never delay or
# block a session.
#
# Overrides:
#   MACF_NO_STARTUP_PICKUP=1   — skip entirely, no query, no submit (family:
#                                MACF_NO_TMUX_WRAP / MACF_OTEL_DISABLED).
#
# Refs: groundnuty/macf#768; DR-026 (auditor never-acts boundary);
